currently unit-tests the motor schema with several data points; requires separate instructions to document how to run it & what should be reported
probably not viable to go all the way up the hierarchy but could go further

note that these data points are gathered by putting debug.log statements in, 
and single-stepping simulation at key points while arranging scene for data to be as desired for the sample
